>> Fit is not the most attractive but this is hugely influenced by the huge gap in count between salary and the other two variables. As such, Assistant Professors that from both yrs.since.phd and yrs.service have a small FIT of about 4 to 6.This tells us that their salary is lower too. Professors are the ones that appear to get a high salary as they have the highest FIT

>> The log transformation does not apprear to have done an excellent job in reexpressing our value. However, there is an improvement with our reexpresed data. Prof how only shows one outlier rather than the two that appeared in the previous boxplot.The AsstProf spread is now more visible and is more symmetrical.AssocProf now appears to have a more visible left skew yet its spread has been improved as well. This may not be the best tranformation but it has still fairly done its job in tranforming our data.
